# auth0-react-context-hooks
Code example for my talk at React Edingburgh 

## Getting started

Create an account at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and create credentials for a JavaScript application. 

Then insert your credentials and create new `.env` file in the projects' root directory:

```
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=[AUTH0_DOMAIN]
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=[AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
```

To start the application

```
npm install
npm start
```
